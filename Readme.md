# 📊 Access to Automatic Detection of Keratoconus from Galilei Corneal Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks Dataset.

This project presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically detect Keratoconus (KCN), a progressive non-inflammatory corneal disease, using corneal images obtained from a Galilei Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer. The model employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze corneal topography maps, providing accurate detection of keratoconus from healthy eyes.

## The dataset includes 3538 eyes: 

- **1872** cases with *keratoconus*
- **1666** healthy individuals  

## Four types of color-coded corneal maps were used: 

- Posterior Elevation Best-Fit Toric Aspheric (BFTA)
- Anterior Elevation BFTA
- Anterior Instantaneous Curvature
- Pachymetry maps

## **14 numerical indices** related to corneal characteristics were also included for certain experiments.
